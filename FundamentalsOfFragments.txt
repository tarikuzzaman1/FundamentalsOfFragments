Steps to Create Fragment by XML
	1. Create a subclass of Fragment
		- HelloFragment.java
	2. Create a layout for Fragment
		- fragment_hello.xml
	3. Link layout with Fragment subclass
		- Override onCreateView
	4. Place the Fragment inside an Activity	(to place the fragment inside an activity by using the tag of <fragment> inside the activity_main.xml)
		- <fragment> inside activity_main.xml


FragmentManager:
	- FragmentManager is responsible to handle all of these fragments inside each of the Activity class.
	- All of these fragments are actually handled bu an interface known as FragmentManager.
	- so the FragmentManager is actually an interface to interact with Fragment objects inside the Activity.
	- FragmentManager, it actually manages all the fragments.
	
	Summary - Manages all fragment objects inside the Activity.
	
FragmentTransaction:
	- So the transactions are actually, we add a Fragment, then we add Fragment B, then we remove Fragment B,
	
	
Fragment Transaction taking place:
	- Fragment A - add
	- Fragment B - add
	- Fragment B - remove
	- Fragment C - add
	- Fragment D - add
	
	Summary - API to perform a set of Fragment operations
			- Add, Remove and Replace operations
			- Adding Fragment to an Activity programmatically is more preferred than adding Fragment by XML

- So all these addition and removal of the Fragments are known as fragment transactions
- Fragment operations such as add, remove, replace a Fragment, attach a Fragment, detach a Fragment, show a Fragment, or hide a Fragment.

	4. Place the Fragment inside an Activity
		- Initialise FragmentManager
		- Initialise FragmentTransaction
		- Start add/remove/replace operation
		- Commit the transaction

Programmatically add Fragment using Java

*** - So there is always one instance of a FragmentManager for one activity.
